# Minimum Coins

Program that given a number of pennies will calculate the minimum number of Sterling coins needed to make that amount.

* 123p = 1 x £1, 1 x 20p, 1 x 2p, 1 x 1p

* £12.34 = 6 x £2, 1 x 20p, 1 x 10p, 2 x 2p


## Technologies used

* It uses javascript, bootstrap3, Qunit, Jquery.

## How to run the code

* Clone the repo

* Open pennies_js/src/index.html from any browser (recommended to be modern browser)

* Add the input as illustrated in the description and check the output below it.


## How to run the test

* Open pennies_js/src/tests/tests.html from any browser.

* Check the output of the unit tests.


## Notes:

* There are two types to program these algorith:

  - Using Dynamic programming

  - Using recursion

* I used dynamic programming due to the performance.

* You will find the recurrsion method written and commented in the code for reference.
